                    <p class="image__description"> David Blazer is a songwriter and music producer with the ability to bridge modern sensibilities with traditional forms of jazz, R&B, hip hop, and pop music. He strives to take something strangely familiar and make it brand new and never wants to write the same thing twice.</p>
                    <p class="image__description">In each song, Blazer gives room for each aspect of his talent repertoire to shine through. In Reasons, his vocals are truly a gift, while the instruments and production make for a great inclusion as well.</p>
